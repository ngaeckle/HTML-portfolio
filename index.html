                <strong>I went to school at Purdue University and Loyola of Chicago</strong>

                <p> Right after I graduated highschool I spent a year at Purdue University. Although when I got there I decided that I wanted to switch my major from Computer Information Technologies to Computer Science. Unfortunately the CS program at Purdue is unbelievably difficult to get into, and unbelievably competative for current students. When the results came out, Purdue had decided to not let a single person switch majors into the CS program, and had only allowed incoming freshman spots in the program. So for that reason and a few others, I decided I wanted to transfer out and started my next semester at Loyola of Chicago. Everything was going great at Loyola, I honestly still have no complaints about the school, but I did learn a lot about myself during my semester there, and I learned that college is just not the right place for me right now. So I transfered out of Loyola as well, and am now focusing my time at Coding Temple.</p>

                <p>My family and I took a trip to Hawaii during our winter break. We took a flight to Honolulu, Hawaii and spent a weekend there. After Honolulu, we took a flight to the big island and rented a house there. We spent a lot of time at the beach and we went snorkeling. We also went hiking around volcanoes and got to see real lava. We got to visit the most southern point of the united states, we visited black sand beaches, ziplined over a waterfall, and saw dolphins on a boat tour.</p>
